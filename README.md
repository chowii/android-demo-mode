The idea of this app is meant to simplify the process of toggling demo mode of android system ui, to enable for cleaner
screenshots used in demos, presentations, or sharing with team members internally.

The primary benefit of this app is that it leverages Android's Tile Service to toggle between demo active and
inactive mode, while also exploring and gaining experience and knowledge of the TileService api.

As a side exploration, to store user preferences and data locally on the app, the project utilizes
android jetpack Preferences DataStore to store data, while also enabling to gain experience and knowledge
with consuming APIs that use Kotlin Flow
